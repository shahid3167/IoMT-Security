# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a blockchain-based IoT framework for managing 1100 IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) nodes. The system is designed to ensure secure, efficient, and scalable management of IoMT nodes by utilizing a blockchain network and clustering mechanism. The implementation consists of three main algorithms:

Main Algorithm: Orchestrates the entire process of initializing the blockchain and clusters, registering IoMT nodes, providing cluster heads, and assigning nodes to cluster heads.
Algorithm 2 (registerIoMTNode): Handles the registration of IoMT nodes into the blockchain network.
Algorithm 3 (provideClusterHead): Manages the provisioning of cluster heads and the assignment of IoMT nodes to these heads.

# Main Algorithm (Purpose)
The main algorithm serves as the central control point for the entire system. It initializes the blockchain and cluster structures, registers 1100 IoMT nodes into the blockchain, provides several cluster heads, assigns nodes to cluster heads, and outputs the final blockchain and cluster information.

## Detailed Steps
1. Initialization: Create an instance of the Blockchain class to manage the blockchain network.
Create an instance of the Cluster class to manage the cluster heads and their assigned nodes.

2. Node Registration: Generate 1100 IoMT nodes, each with a unique identifier and associated data.
Register each node into the blockchain by calling the registerIoMTNode function. This function adds a new block to the blockchain with the node's information.
Cluster Head Provisioning:

3. Create cluster heads to manage groups of IoMT nodes. Register each cluster head by calling the provideClusterHead function. This function adds the cluster head to the cluster management system.

4. Node Assignment: Randomly assign each IoMT node to a cluster head. This ensures that nodes are evenly distributed among the available cluster heads for balanced management.
Output:

# Algorithm 2: Register IoMT Node
This algorithm handles the registration of IoMT nodes into the blockchain network. Each IoMT node is represented as a block in the blockchain, ensuring secure and immutable storage of node data.

# Detailed Steps
1. Block Class: Represents a block in the blockchain. Each block contains an index, data, hash, and the hash of the previous block. The generateHash method generates a unique hash for the block based on its contents.

2. Blockchain Class: Manages the entire blockchain. The genesis block (the first block) is created upon initialization. The addBlock method adds new blocks to the blockchain.

3. IoMTNode Class: Represents an IoMT node with an ID and associated data.

4. Register Function: Adds a new block to the blockchain with the node's ID and data.

# Algorithm 3: Provide Cluster Head
This algorithm manages the provisioning of cluster heads and the assignment of IoMT nodes to these heads. Cluster heads are responsible for managing groups of IoMT nodes, ensuring efficient data aggregation and communication.

Detailed Steps
1. ClusterHead Class: Represents cluster heads and maintains a list of assigned nodes. The assignNode method assigns a node to the cluster head.

2. Cluster Class: Manages cluster heads and their nodes. The addClusterHead method adds a new cluster head. The assignNodeToClusterHead method assigns a node to a specific cluster head.

3. Provide Function: Adds a cluster head to the cluster management system.
